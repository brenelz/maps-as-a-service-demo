# Maps as a Service Demo

This is a super simple project that uses <a href="https://maps-as-a-service.netlify.app/">this service</a> to show a google map using a custom api you build.

The idea is that there is a simple json api that stores you locations to put on a google map. These could come from a CMS like Contentful or something else.
